# Intermediate Development with Node.js

## Course Summary

### Description
This course builds on the fundamentals of Node.js to help developers deepen their skills in server-side JavaScript. It covers advanced asynchronous programming techniques, performance optimization, security, testing, and scalable application design. Participants will explore real-world use cases such as building RESTful APIs, managing stateful applications, integrating databases, and deploying applications. Through hands-on labs, students will gain the experience necessary to create production-ready Node.js applications.

### Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Build advanced RESTful APIs and microservices with Node.js and Express.
- Use advanced asynchronous patterns (async iterators, workers, queues, streams).
- Apply security best practices (authentication, authorization, environment management).
- Optimize performance and manage scalability in Node.js applications.
- Use clustering, worker threads, and load balancing for concurrency.
- Write and maintain automated tests for Node.js codebases.
- Integrate with SQL and NoSQL databases, including advanced queries and transactions.
- Use WebSockets for real-time communication.
- Deploy Node.js applications to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or similar).
- Apply logging, monitoring, and debugging strategies for production environments.
