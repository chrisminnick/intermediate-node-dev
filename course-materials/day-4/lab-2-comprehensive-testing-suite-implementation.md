# Lab 2: Comprehensive Testing Suite Implementation

## Objective

Design and implement a robust testing suite for a Node.js application using unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Unit & Integration Testing

1. Set up a Node.js project with `jest` or `mocha` and `chai`.
2. Write unit tests for core functions and modules.
3. Write integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions.

### Part 2: End-to-End Testing

1. Use a tool like `supertest` or `cypress` to simulate user interactions and test the full application flow.
2. Ensure tests cover edge cases and error handling.

### Part 3: Test Coverage & Automation

1. Generate a test coverage report.
2. Set up automated test runs (e.g., with npm scripts or GitHub Actions).

## Deliverables

- Test suite code
- Coverage report
- Instructions for running tests
