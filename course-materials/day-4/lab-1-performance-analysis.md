# Lab 1: Application Performance Analysis & Optimization

## Objective

Analyze and optimize the performance of a Node.js application using profiling tools and code improvements.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Profiling

1. Clone or use a sample Node.js application with known performance bottlenecks.
2. Use built-in Node.js profiling tools (`--inspect`, Chrome DevTools, or `clinic.js`) to identify slow functions and memory leaks.
3. Record baseline performance metrics (response time, memory usage, CPU load).

### Part 2: Optimization

1. Refactor code to address bottlenecks (e.g., async patterns, caching, efficient data structures).
2. Re-run profiling tools to compare before/after metrics.
3. Document the optimizations and their impact.

## Deliverables

- Profiling reports (screenshots or logs)
- Optimized code samples
- Summary of improvements and results
