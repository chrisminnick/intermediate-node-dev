# Lab 1: Docker Containerization & Cloud Deployment

## Objective

Containerize a Node.js application using Docker and deploy it to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku).

## Instructions

### Part 1: Dockerization

1. Write a `Dockerfile` for a sample Node.js app.
2. Build and run the container locally.
3. Test the app inside the container.

### Part 2: Cloud Deployment

1. Push the Docker image to a container registry (Docker Hub or cloud provider).
2. Deploy the container to a cloud service (Heroku, AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, etc.).
3. Verify the deployment and access the app remotely.

## Deliverables

- Dockerfile and related config
- Deployment instructions
- Screenshots or logs of successful deployment
